<p>Abstract—Attention is an important mechanism that can be employed for a variety of deep learning models across many different domains and tasks. This survey provides an overview of the most important attention mechanisms proposed in the literature. The various attention mechanisms are explained by means of a framework consisting of a general attention model, uniform notation, and a comprehensive taxonomy of attention mechanisms. Furthermore, the various measures for evaluating attention models are reviewed and methods to characterize the structure of attention models based on the proposed framework are discussed. Last, future work in the field of attention models is considered</p>

<h3 id="1INTRODUCTION"><a href="#1INTRODUCTION" class="headerlink" title="1INTRODUCTION"></a>1INTRODUCTION</h3><p>Hdemao model was created for machine translation, but was quickly adopted tobe used for other tasks, such as image processing [15], video processing [16], and recommender systems [17]. The purpose of this survey is to explain the general</p>
<p>the computational complexity of image processing while improving performance by introducing a model that would only focus on specific regions of images instead of the entire picture. Although, the true starting point of the attention mechanisms we know today is often attributed to originate in the field of natural language processing [3]. Bahdanau et al.[3] implement attention in a machine translation model to address certain issues with the structure of recurrent neural networks. After Bahdanau et al. [3] emphasized the advantages of attention, the attention techniques were refined [4] and quickly became popular for a variety of tasks, such as text classification [5], [6], image captioning [7], [8], sentiment analysis [6], [9], and speech recognition [10], [11], [12] Attention has become a popular technique in deep learn-</p>
<p>form of attention,and provide a comprehensive overview of attention techniques in deep learning. Other surveys have already been published on the subject of attention models For example, in [18], a survey is presented on attention in computer vision, [19] provides an overview of attention in graph models, and [20], [21],[22] are all surveys on attention in natural language processing. This paper partly builds on the information presented in the previously mentioned surveys. Yet, we provide our own significant contributions The main difference between this survey and the previously mentioned ones is that the other surveys generally focus on attention models within a certain domain. This survey however, provides a cross-domain overview of attention techniques. We discuss the attention techniques in a general way, allowing them to be understood and applied in a variety of domains. Furthermore, we found the taxonomies presented in previous surveys to be lacking the depth and structure needed to properly distinguish the various attention mechanisms. Additionally, certain significant attention techniques have not yet been properly discussed in previous surveys, while other presented attention mechanisms seem to be lacking either technical details or intuitive explanations. Therefore, in this paper, we present important attention techniques by means of a single framework using a uniform notation,a combination of both technical and in tuitive explanations for each presented attention technique, and a comprehensive taxonomy of attention mechanisms The structure of this paper is as follows. Section 2 in-</p>
<p>ing for several reasons. Firstly, models that incorporate attention mechanisms attain state-of-the-art results for all of the previously mentioned tasks, and many others. Furthermore, most attention mechanisms can be trained jointly with a base model, such as a recurrent neural network or a convolutional neural network using regular backpropa gation [3]. Additionally, attention introduces a certain type of interpretation into neural network models [8] that are generally known to be highly complicated to interpret. Moreover, the popularity of attention mechanisms was additionally boosted after the introduction of the Transformer model [i3] that further proved how effective attention can be.Attention was originally introduced as an extension to recurrent neural networks [14]. However, the Transformer model proposed in [13] poses a major development in attention research as it demonstrates that the attention mechanism is sufficient to build a state-of-the-art model. This means that disadvantages, such as the fact that recurrent neural networks are particularly difficult to parallelize, can</p>
<p>troduces a general attention model that provides the reader with a basic understanding of the properties of attention and how it can be applied. One of the main contributions of this paper is the taxonomy of attention techniques presented in Section 3. In this section, attention mechanisms are explained and categorized according to the presented</p>

<p>taxonomy. Section 4 provides an overview of performance measures and methods for evaluating attention models. Furthermore,the taxonomy is used to evaluate the structure of various attention models. Lastly, in Section 5, we give oun conclusions and suggestions for further research</p>
<h2 id="2-General-Attention-Model"><a href="#2-General-Attention-Model" class="headerlink" title="2 General Attention Model"></a>2 General Attention Model</h2><p>This section presents a general form of attention with corresponding notation. The notation introduced here is based on the notation that was introduced in [23] and popularized in [13]. The framework presented in this section is used throughout the rest of this paper. To implement a general attention model, it is necessary</p>
<p>to first describe the general characteristics of a model that can employ attention. First of all, we will refer to the complete model as the task model, of which the structure is presented in Fig. 1. This model simply takes an input, carries out the specified task, and produces the desired output.For example, the task model can be a language model that takes as input a piece of text, and produces as output a summary of the contents,a classification of the sentiment, or the text translated word for word to another language. Alternatively the task model can take an image, and produce a captionthe general attention module is the query $q\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{q}}$, andthe or segmentation for that image. The task model consists of four submodels: the feature model, the query model, the attention model, and the output model. In Subsection 2.1, the feature model and query model are discussed, which are used to prepare the input for the attention calculation. In Subsection 2.2, the attention model and output model are discussed, which are concerned with producing the output</p>
<h2 id="2-1Attention-Input"><a href="#2-1Attention-Input" class="headerlink" title="2.1Attention Input"></a>2.1Attention Input</h2><p>Suppose the task model takes as input the matrix $X\in$ $\Pi_{\mathcal{R}}d_{\mathcal{F}}\times\boldsymbol{n}<em>{\mathcal{X}}$ where $d</em>{x}$ represents the size of the input vectors and $n_{x}$ represents the amount of input vectors. The columns in this matrix can represent the words in a sentence the pixels in an image, the characteristics of an acoustic sequence, or any other collection of inputs.The feature model is then employed to extract the $n_{f}$ feature vectors $f_1,\ldots,f_{n_f}\in\mathbb{R}^d_f$ from $X$ where $d_{f}$ represents the size of the feature vectors.The feature model can be a recurrent neural network (RNN), a convolutional neural network (CNN), a simple embedding layer, a linear transformation of the original data, or no transformation at all. Essentially, the feature model consists of all the steps that transform the original input $X$ into the feature vectors $f_{1},\ldots,f_{n_{f}}$ that the attention modelwill attend to.</p>

<p>Fig. 2. The inner mechanisms of the general attention module</p>
<p>To determine which vectors to attend to,the attention model requires the query $q\in\mathbb{H}^d_q$ ,where $d_q$ indicates the size of the query vector. This query is extracted by the query model, and is generally designed based on the type of output that is desired of the model. A query tells the attention model which feature vectors to attend to.It can be interpreted literally as a query, or a question. For example, for the task of image captioning, suppose that one uses a decoder RNN model to produce the output caption based on feature vectors obtained from the image by a CNN.At each prediction step, the hidden state of the RNN model can be used as a query to attend to the CNN feature vectors. In each step, the query is a question in the sense that it asks for the necessary information from the feature vectors based on the current prediction context</p>
<h3 id="2-2-Attention-Output"><a href="#2-2-Attention-Output" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Attention Output"></a>2.2 Attention Output</h3><p>The feature vectors and query are used as input for the attention model. This model consists of a single, or a collection of general attention modules.An overview of a general attention module is presented in Fig. 2. The input of matrix of feature vectors $\boldsymbol{F}&#x3D;[\boldsymbol{f}<em>{1},\ldots,\boldsymbol{f}</em>{n_{f}}]\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{f}\times n_{f}}.$ Two separate matrices are extracted from the matrix $F$ : the keys matrix $K&#x3D;[k_{1},\ldots,k_{n_{f}}]\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{k}\times n_{f}}$, and the values matrix $V$ &#x3D; $[ \boldsymbol{v}<em>1, \ldots , \boldsymbol{v}</em>{n_f}]$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{d_v\times n_f}$, where $d_{k}$ and $d_{v}$ indicate, respectively, the dimensions of the key vectors (columns of $K$ ) and value vectors (columns of $V$ ). The general way of obtaining these matrices is through a linear transformation of $F$ using the weight matrices. $W_{K}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{k}\times d_{f}}$ and $W_{V}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{v}\times d_{f}}$ ,for $K$ and $V$ , respectively. The calculations of $K$ and $V$ are presented in (1). Both weight matrices can be learned during training or predefined by the researcher For example, one can choose to define both $W_{K}$ and $W_{V}$ as equal to the identity matrix to retain the original feature vectors. Other ways of defining the keys and the values are also possible, such as using completely separate inputs for the keys and values. The only constraint to be obeyed is that the number of columns in $K$ and $V$ remains the same<br>$$K_{d_{k}\times n_{f}}&#x3D;W_{K}\times F_{d_{f}\times n_{f}},\quad V_{d_{v}\times n_{f}}&#x3D;W_{V}\times F_{d_{f}\times n_{f}}.$$</p>
<p>The goal of the attention module is to produce a weighted average of the value vectors in $V$ .The weights used to produce this output are obtained via an attention scoring and alignment step.The query $q$ and the keys matrix $K$ are used to calculate thevector of attention scores</p>
<p>$\boldsymbol{e}&#x3D;\left[e_{1},\ldots,e_{n_{f}}\right]\in\mathbb{R}^{n_{f}}.$ This is done via the score function score(), as illustrated in (2)</p>
<p>$$e_{l}:&#x3D;:\mathrm{score}(:q:,:k_{l}:).$$</p>
<p>As discussed before, the query symbolizes a request for information. The attention score $e_{1}$ represents how important the information contained in the key vector $k_{l}$ is according to the query. If the dimensions of the query and key vectors are the same, an example of a score function would be to take the dot-product of the vectors. The different types of score functions are further discussed in Section 3.2.1. Next, the attention scores are processed further through</p>
<p>an alignment layer. The attention scores can generally have a wide range outside of [0,1] . However, since the goal is to produce a weighted average, the scores are redistributed via an alignment function align() as defined in (3).</p>
<p>$$\begin{matrix}a_l&amp;&#x3D;\text{align}(\begin{array}{c}e_l:;&amp;\boldsymbol{e}\1\times1&amp;n_f\times1\end{array}),\end{matrix}$$</p>
<p>where $a_l\in\mathbb{R}^1$ is the attention weight corresponding to the lth value vector.One example of an alignment function wouldbe touse a softmax function,but the various other alignment types are discussed in Section 3.2.2. The attention weights provide a rather intuitive interpretation for the attention module. Each weight is a direct indication of how important each feature vector is relative to the others for this particular problem. This can provide us with a more in-depth understanding of the model behaviour, and the re lations between inputs and outputs. The vector of attention weights $a$ &#x3D; $[ a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n_{f}}]$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{n_{f}}$ is used to produce the context vector $c\in\mathbb{R}^{d_v}$ by calculating a weighted average of the columns of the values matrix $V$ ,as shown in (4)<br>$$\boldsymbol{c}<em>{d_v\times1}&#x3D;\sum</em>{l&#x3D;1}^{n_f}a_l:\times:\boldsymbol{v}_l:.$$</p>
<p>As illustrated in Fig. 1, the context vector is then used in the output model to create the output $\ddot{y}$ This output model translates the context vector into an output prediction. For example, it could be a simple softmax layer that takes as input the context vector $C$ , as shown in (5)</p>
<p>$$\hat{\boldsymbol{y}}<em>{d</em>{y}\times1}&#x3D;\mathrm{softmax}(W_{c}:\times:c_{d_{y}\times1}:+:b_{c}:),$$</p>
<p>where $d_{y}$ is the number of output choices or classes, and $W_{c}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{y}\times d_{v}}$ and $b_{c}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}$ are trainable weights</p>
<h3 id="2-3-Attention-Applications"><a href="#2-3-Attention-Applications" class="headerlink" title="2.3 Attention Applications"></a>2.3 Attention Applications</h3><p>Attention is a rather general mechanism that can be used in a wide variety of problem domains. Consider the task of machine translation using an RNN model. Also, consider the problem of image classification using a basic CNN model. While an RNN produces a sequence of hidden state vectors, a CNN creates feature maps, where each region in the image is represented by a feature vector. The RNN hidden states are organized sequentially, while the CNN feature maps are organized spatially. Yet, attention can still be applied in both situations, since the attention mechanism does not inherently depend on the organization of thefeature vectors. This characteristic makes attention easy to implement in a wide variety of models in different domains.</p>
<p>Another domain where attention can be applied is audio processing [24], [25]. Acoustic sequences can be represented by a sequence of feature vectors that relate to certain time periods of the audio sample. These vectors could simply be the raw input audio, or they can be extracted via,for example, an RNN or CNN. Video processing is another domain where attention can be applied intuitively [26], [27] Video data consists of sequences of images, so attention can be applied to the individual images, as well as the entire sequence. Recommender systems often incorporate a users interaction history to produce recommendations. Feature vectors can be extracted based on, for example, the id’s or other characteristics of the products the user interacted with, and attention can be applied to them [28]. Attention can generally also be applied to many problems that use a time series as input, be it medical [29], financial [30], or anything else, as long as feature vectors can be extracted The fact that attention does not rely on the organization</p>
<p>of the feature vectors allows it to be applied to various problems that each use data with different structures, as illustrated by the previous domain examples.Yet,this can be taken even further by applying attention to data where there is irregular structure. For example, protein structures, city traffic flows, and communication networks cannot always be represented using neatly structured organizations, such as sequences, like time series, or grids, like images. In such cases, the different aspects of the data are often represented as nodes in a graph. These nodes can be represented by feature vectors, meaning that attention can be applied in domains that use graph-structured data as well [19],[31] In general, attention can be applied to any problem for</p>
<p>which a set of feature vectors can be defined or extracted As such, the general attention model presented in Fig. 2 is applicable to a wide range of domains. The problem,how ever, is that there is a large variety of different applications and extensions of the general attention module. As such, in Section 3, a comprehensive overview is provided of a collection of different attention mechanisms.</p>
<h2 id="3ATTENTION-TAXONOMY"><a href="#3ATTENTION-TAXONOMY" class="headerlink" title="3ATTENTION TAXONOMY"></a>3ATTENTION TAXONOMY</h2><p>There are many different types of attention mechanisms and extensions,and a model can use different combinations of these attention techniques. As such, we propose a taxonomy that can be used to classify different types of attention mechanisms. Fig. 3 provides a visual overview of the different categories and subcategories that the attention mechanisms can be organized in. The three major categories are based on whether an attention technique is designed to handle specific types of feature vectors (feature-related), specific types of model queries (query-related), or whether it is simply a general mechanism that is related to neither the feature model, nor the query model (general). Further explanations of these categories and their subcategories are provided in the following subsections. Each mechanism discussedin this section is either amodification to the existing inner mechanisms of the general attention module presented in Section 2, or an extension of it The presented taxonomy can also be used to analyze</p>
<p>the architecture of attention models.Namely, the major categories and their subcategories can be interpreted as</p>

<p>For most tasks, a model only processes a single input, such as an image, a sentence, or an acoustic sequence. We refer to such a mechanism as singular features attention. Other models are designed to use attention based on multiple inputs to allow one to introduce more information into the model that can be exploited in various ways.However, this does imply the presence of multiple feature matrices that require special attention mechanisms to be fully used. For example, [32] introduces a concept named co-attention to allow the proposed visual question answering (VQA) model to jointly attend to both an image and a question Co-attention mechanisms can generally be split up</p>
<p>into two groups [33]: coarse-grained co-attention and fine-grained co-attention. The difference between the two groups is the way attention scores are calculated based on the two feature matrices. Coarse-grained attention mecha-. nisms use a compact representation of one feature matrix as a query when attending to the other feature vectors. Fine-grained co-attention, on the other hand, uses all feature vectors of one input as queries. As such, no information is lost, which is why these mechanisms are called fine-grained As an example of coarse-grained co-attention, [32] pro-</p>
<p>orthogonal dimensions of an attention model. An attention model can consist of a combination of techniques taken from any or all categories. Some characteristics, such as the scoring and alignment functions, are generally required for any attention model. Other mechanisms, such as multihead attention or co-attention are not necessary in every situation. Lastly, in Table 1, an overview of used notation with corresponding descriptions is provided.</p>
<p>poses an alternating co-attention mechanism that uses the context vector (which is a compact representation) from one attention module as the query for the other module, and vice versa. Alternating co-attention is presented in Fig. 4. Given a set of two input matrices $X^{(1)}$ and $X^{(2)}$ , features are extracted by a feature model to produce the feature extracts feature vectors so that the attention model canmatrices $F^{(1)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_f^{(1)}\times n_f^{(1)}}$ and $F^{(2)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{f}^{(2)}\times n_{f}^{(2)}}$ ,where $d_{f}^{(1)}$</p>

<p>vectors extracted from the first and second inputs, while co-attention is used for VQA, so the two input matrices are the image data and the question data, for which the feature model for the image consists of a CNN model, and the feature modelfor the question consists of word embeddings a convolutional layer, a pooling layer, and an LSTM model. Firstly, attention is calculated for the first set of features $F^{(1)}$ without the use of a query (Attention Module in Fig. 4). In as a weighted average of the second set of value vectors [32], an adjusted additive attention score function is used for this attention mechanism.The general form of the regularattention module,which will produce the context vector additive score function can be seen in (6).<br>$$\mathrm{score}(:\boldsymbol{q}:,:\boldsymbol{k}<em>{l}:)&#x3D;:\boldsymbol{w}^{T}\times\mathrm{act}(\boldsymbol{W}</em>{1}\times:\boldsymbol{q}:+:\boldsymbol{W}<em>{2}\times:\boldsymbol{k}</em>{l}+\boldsymbol{b}:),\d_{q}\times1\quad d_{k}\times1\quad1\times d_{w}\quad d_{w}\times d_{q}\quad d_{q}\times1\quad d_{w}\times d_{k}\quad d_{k}\times1\quad d_{w}\times1$$</p>
<p>where act() is a non-linear activation function, and $w\in$ $\Pi^{\mathcal{R}}d_{\mathcal{n}\mathcal{F}}$ ， $W_{1}$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{d_{w}\times d_{q}}$ ， $W_{2}\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{d_{w}\times d_{k}}$, and $b\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{w}}$ are trainable weights matrices, for which $d_{w}$ is a predefined dimension of the weight matrices.A variant of this score function adapted to be calculated without a query for the application at hand can be seen in (7).</p>
<p>$$e_{l}^{(0)}&#x3D;\boldsymbol{w}^{(1)T}\times\operatorname{act}(\boldsymbol{W}^{(1)}\times\boldsymbol{k}<em>{l}^{(1)}+\boldsymbol{b}^{(1)}),\1\times1\quad1\times d</em>{w}\quad d_{w}\times d_{k}^{(1)}\quad d_{k}^{(1)}\times1\quad d_{w}\times1$$</p>
<p>where $w^{(1)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{w}}$ ， $W^{(1)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\omega}\times d_{k}^{(1)}}$ and $b^{(1)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{M}}$ areafter another. This may come with a computational distrainable weight matrices for Attention Module,. $k_l^{(1)}\in$ advantage since it is not possible to parallize. Instead of $\Pi\text{砥}^{d_k^{(1)}}$ is the Ith column of the keys matrix $K^{(1)}$ that wasusing a sequential mechanism like alternating co-attention, obtained from $F^{(1)}$ via a linear transformation (see (1), for which $d_{w}$ is a prespecified dimension of the weight matrices and $d_{k}^{(1)}$ is a prespecifiedimension of the key vectors. Perhaps onemay wonder why the query is absent whenqueries,unweighted averages of the keyvectors areused as</p>
<p>calculating attention in this manner. Essentially, the query in this attention modelis learned alongside the other trainable parameters. As such, the query can be interpreted as a general question: “Which feature vectors contain the most important information?”.This is also known as a selfattentive mechanism, since attention is calculated based only on the feature vectors themselves. Self-attention is explained in more detail in Subsection 3.3.1 The scores are combined with an alignment function</p>
<p>(see (3)), such as the softmax function, to create attention weights used to calculate the context vector $\boldsymbol{c}^{(0)}\in\mathbb{R}^{\boldsymbol{d}<em>{\mathbb{V}}^{(1)}}$ (see (4). This context vector is not used as the output of the attention model, but rather as a query for calculating the context vector $\boldsymbol{c}^{(2)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d</em>{w}^{(2)}}$ based on the second feature vectors $c^{(1)}$ and $c^{(2)}$ matrix $F^{(2)}$ where $d_{v}^{\langle2\rangle}$ is thedimension of the valuevectors obtained from $F^{(2)}$ via a linear transformation (see (1).For compact representation of one input to use as a query when</p>

<p>These attention scores are then used to calculate attentior weights using, for example, a softmax function as alignment function,after which the context vector $c^{(2)}$ can bederived Finally, the context vector $c^{(2)}$ is used as a query for the first $c^{(1)}$ for the first feature matrix $F^{(1)}$ .Attention scores are calculated according to (9). In [32], the same function and weight matrices as seen in (7) are used, but with an added query making it the same as the general additive score function (see (6)). The rest of the attention calculation is similar as before</p>
<p>$$e_{l}^{(1)}&#x3D;\mathrm{score}(\begin{array}{c}c^{(2)}:,:k_{l}^{(1)}:).\d_{v}^{(2)}\times1:d_{k}^{(1)}\times1\end{array}$$</p>
<p>The produced context vectors $c^{(1)}$ and $c^{(2)}$ are concatenated and used for prediction in the output model.Alternating co-attention inherently contains a form of sequentiality due to the fact that context vectors need to be calculated one [34] proposes the interactive co-attention mechanism that can calculate attention on both feature matrices in parallel, as depicted in Fig. 5. Instead of using the context vectors as queries.The calculation of the average keys are provided in (10), and the calculation of the attention scores are shown in (11). Any score function can be used in this case, but an additive score function is used in [34]</p>

<p>From the attention scores, attention weights are created via an alignment function, and are used to produce the context</p>
<p>While coarse-grained co-attention mechanisms use a</p>
<p>calculating attention for another input, fine-grained coattention considers every element of each input individually when calculating attention scores.In this case, the query becomes a matrix. An example of fine-grained co-attention is parallel co-attention [32]. Similarly to interactive coattention, parallel co-attention calculates attention on the two feat ue mariesa hesaemeti e $K^{(1)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_k^{(1)}\times n_f^{(1)}}$ .d $K^{(2)}\in\mathbb{R}<em>{k}^{d</em>{k}^{(2)}\times n_{f}^{(2)}}$ that are obtained by linearly transforming the feature matrices $F^{(1)}$ and $F^{(2)}$ ,where $d_k^{(1)}$ and $d_k^{(2)}$ are $K^{(1)}$ C $K^{(2)}$ Sopdehna tiset dtoedere $A$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{n_f^{( \dagger ) }\times n_f^{( 2) }}$ difet die eastons sn afitysaeix atento sore asho na 6) translate one keys matrix to the space of the other keys.

<p>where $w_{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{3d_{k}}$ denotes a trainable vector of weights, concat() denotes vector concatenation, and 0 denotes element-wise multiplication, also known as the Hadamard product. Note that the keys of each keys matrix in this case must have the same dimension $d_{k}$ for the element wise multiplication to work.The affinity matrix can be interpreted as a similarity matrix for the columns of the two keys matrices, and helps translate, for example, image keys to the same space as the keys of the words in a sentence, and vice versa.The vectors of attention scores $e^{(1)}$ and $e^{(2)}$ can be calculated using an altered version of the additive score function as presented in (14) and (15). The previous attention score example i this survey all used a score func- fllowing feature matrices:. $\boldsymbol{F}^{t}$ &#x3D; $[ \boldsymbol{f}<em>{1}^{t}, \ldots , \boldsymbol{f}</em>{n_{f}^{t}}^{t}]$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{d_{f}^{t}\times n_{f}^{t}}$ tion to calculate each attention score for each value vector individually. However, (14) and (15) are used to calculate $F^{l}$ &#x3D; $[ f_{1}^{l}, \ldots , f_{n_{f}^{l}}^{l}]$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{d_{f}^{l}\times n_{f}^{l}}.$ and $F^{r}$ &#x3D; $[ f_{1}^{r}, \ldots , f_{n_{f}^{r}}^{r}]$ $\in$ the complete vector of all attention scores. Essentially, the $\mathbb{R}^{d_f^r\times n_f^r}$, for the target phrase words, left context words, attention scores are calculated in an aggregated form.</p>

In that case, the affinity matrix $A$ can be seen as a translator between feature spaces. As mentioned before, the affinity matrix is essentially a similarity matrix for the key vectors of the two</p>

<p>Next,the attention scores are used to calculate attention vectors $c^{(1)}$ and $c^{(2)}$ can be derived as weighted averages of the value vectors that are obtained from linearly transform ing the features. For the alignment function, [32] proposes is used in[32].[35] proposes a different way of calculatingtouse a softmaxfunction,and thevalue vectors are simply set equal to the feature vectors. The resulting context vectors can be either concatenated or added together Finally, coarse-grained and fine-grained co-attention can</p>

[33] proposes the multi-grained co-attention mechanism that calculates both coarse-grained and finegrained co-attention for two inputs.Each mechanism produces one context vector per input.

<p>multiple inputs is the rotatory attention mechanism [36] This technique is typically used in a text sentiment analysis setting where there are three inputs involved: the phrase for which the sentiment needs to be determined (target phrase) the text before the target phrase (left context), and the text after the target phrase (right context). The words in these three inputs are all encoded by the feature model, producing the</p>

The feature model used in[36]consists of word embeddings and separate Bi-LSTM models for the target phrase, the left context, and the right context. This means that the feature vectors arein fact thehidden statevectors obtained from the $W_{2}\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{d_{w}\times d_{k}^{( 2) }}$ are trainable weight matrices, for which Bi-LSTM models. Using these features, the idea is to extract $d_{w}$ is a prespecified dimension of the weight matrices. Note a single vector $T^*$ from the inputs such that a softmax layer can be used for classification. As such, we are now faced with two challenges: how to represent the inputs as a single vector, and how to incorporate the information from the left and right context into that vector. [36] proposes to use the rotatory attention mechanism for this purpose.</p>
<p>Firstly, a single target phrase representation is created most importantinformation in the actual target phrase itself by using a pooling layer that takes the average over the Essentially, the mechanism rotates attention between the columns of $F^{t}$ ,as shown in (17).</p>
<p>$$r_{<em>{d</em>{f}^{t}\times1}}^{t}&#x3D;\frac{1}{n_{f}^{t}}\sum_{i&#x3D;1}^{n_{f}^{t}}f_{i}^{t}:.$$</p>
<p>$r^{l}$ is then used as a query to create a context vector out of various scans or documents, that can provide different types the left and right contexts, separately. For example, for the left context,the key vectors $k_{1}^{l},\ldots,k_{n_{f}^{l}}^{l}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{k}^{l}}$ and value vectors $\boldsymbol{v}<em>{1}^{l},\ldots,\boldsymbol{v}</em>{n_{f}^{l}}^{l}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\nu}^{l}}$ are extracted rom the let context mages and semantic l gsimuldaneously iel aly n $d_{k}^{l}$ tire $d_{v}^{l}$ cors $f_{1}^{l},\ldots,f_{n_{f}^{l}}^{l}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{f}^{l}}$ sima ee ee e e respectively. Note that [36] proposes to use the original feature vectors as keys and values, meaning that the linear transformation consists of a multiplication by an identity matrix. Next, the scores are calculated using (18).</p>
<p>$$e_{i}^{l}&#x3D;\text{score}(\begin{array}{c}r^{t}\d_{f}^{t}\times1\end{array},\begin{array}{c}k_{i}^{l}\d_{k}^{l}\times1\end{array}).$$</p>
<p>For the score function, [36] proposes to use an activated general score function [34] with a tanh activation function. The attention scores can be combined with an alignment function and the corresponding value vectors to produce the context vector $r^{l}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{v}^{l}}$ The alignment function used in [36] takes the form of a softmax function. An analogous procedure can be performed to obtain the representation of the right context, $r^{T}$ .These two context representations can then be used to create new representations of the target phrase, $\Pi\text{思}^d_{k_0}^r$ and value vectors $\boldsymbol{v}<em>{1}^{t}, \ldots , \boldsymbol{v}</em>{n_{f}^{t}}^{t}$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{d_{v}^{t}}$ are extracted from the target phrase feature vectors $f_{1}^{t},\ldots,f_{n_{f}^{t}}^{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{f}^{t}}$ 3.1.2 Feature Levels similarly as before, using a linear transformation, where $d_{k}^{t}$ and $d_{v}^{t}$ are the dimensions of the key and value vectors respectively. Note, again, that the original feature vectors as keys and values in [36]. The attention scores for the leftaware target representation are then calculated using (19).<br>$$e_{i}^{l_{t}}&#x3D;\mathrm{score}(\begin{array}{c}r^{l}\d_{v}^{l}\times1\end{array},\begin{array}{c}k_{i}^{t}\d_{k}^{t}\times1\end{array}).$$</p>
<p>The attention scores can be combined with an alignment function and the corresponding value vectors to produce the context vector $r^{l_t}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_v^t}$ . For this attention calculation, [34] proposes to use the same score and alignment functions as before. The right-aware target representation $r^{r^{\prime}t}$ can be calculated in a similar manner. Finally, to obtain the full representation vector 7 that is used to determine the classification, the vectors $r^{l}$, $r^{r}$, $r^{l_{t}}$, $r^{l_{s}}$ p and $r^{r_t}$ are concatenated together, as shown in (20).</p>
<p>$$r_{(d_{v}^{l}+d_{v}^{r}+d_{v}^{t}+d_{v}^{t})\times1}&#x3D;\mathrm{concat}(\begin{array}{c}r^{l},\d_{v}^{l}\times1\end{array},\begin{array}{c}r^{r},\d_{v}^{t}\times1\end{array},\begin{array}{c}r^{r_{t}}\d_{v}^{t}\times1\end{array}).$$</p>
<p>To summarize, rotatory attention uses the target phrase to compute new representations for the left and right context using attention, and then uses these left and right reprephrase. The first step is designed to capture the words in the left and right contexts that are most important to the target phrase. The second step is there to capture the</p>
<p>target and the contexts to improve the representations. There are many applications where combining informa-</p>
<p>tion from different inputs into a single model can be highly beneficial. For example,in the field of medical data,there are often many different types of data available, such as of information. In [37], a co-attention mechanism is used for automatic medical report generation to attend to both study is used in [38] to show that the co-attention part of the model specifically improves performance. A field where multi-feature attention has been extensively explored is the domain of recommender systems.For example,in [39], a coattention network is proposed that attends to both product reviews and the reviews a user has written. In[40], a model is proposed for video recommendation that attends to both user features and video features. Co-attention techniques have also been used in combination with graph networks for the purpose of, for example, reading comprehension across multiple documents [41] and fake news detection [42]. In comparison to co-attention, rotatory attention has typically been explored only in the field of sentiment analysis, which is most likely due to the specific structure of the data that is necessary to use this technique. An implementation of rotatory attention is proposed in [43] for sentiment analysis, where the mechanism is extended by repeating the attention again, using attention. Firstly,the key vectors $k_{1}^{t},\ldots,k_{n_{f}^{t}}^{t}\in$ wotationto mectively furthen dep byepe repgese aateons</p>
<p>The previously discussed attention mechanisms process. data at a single level. We refer to these attention techniques as single-level attention mechanisms. However, some data. types can be analyzed and represented on multiple levels. For example, when analyzing documents, one can analyze the document at the sentence level, word level,or even the character level. When representations or embeddings of all these levels are available, one can exploit the extra levels of information. For example, one could choose to perform translation based on either just the characters, or just the words of the sentence. However, in [44], a technique named attention-via-attention is introduced that allows one to incorporate information from both the character, and the word levels. The idea is to predict the sentence translation character-by-character, while also incorporating information from a word-level attention module. To begin with, a feature model (consisting of, for ex</p>
<p>ample,word embeddings and RNNs) is used to encode the input sentence into both a character-level feature matrix $\dot{F^{( c) }}$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{d_{f}^{( \mathrm{c} ) }\times n_{f}^{( \mathrm{c} ) }}$ and a word-level feature matrix $F^{( w) }\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{d_{f}^{( w) }\times n_{f}^{( w) }}$ where $d_{f}^{(c)}$ and $n_{f}^{(c)}$ represent, respec tively, the dimension of the embeddings of the characters $d_{\int}^{(w)}$ and $n_{f}^{(w)}$ reee that each level in the data can be represented or embedded When attempting to predict a character in the translated</p>

If we know which words are most important,then it becomes easier to identify which characters in the input sentence are most important. Thus, the next step is to attend to the character-level features in $F^{(c)}$ , with an additional query input: the word-level context vector $c^{(w)}$ . The actual query input for the attention model will therefore be the concatenation of the query $q^{(c)}$ and the are essentially su-amaries of the words in the sentences.

<p>not always be available for each level of the data, or it may be desirable to let the model create the representations during the process by building them from lower level representations. A technique referred to as hierarchical attention [5] can be used in this situation. Hierarchical attention is another technique that allows one to apply attention on different levels of the data.Yet, the exact mechanisms work quite differently compared to attention-via-attention. The idea is to start at the lowest level, and then create representations, or summaries, of the next level using attention. This process is repeated till the highest level is reached. To make this a little clearer, suppose one attempts to create a model for document classification, similarly to the implementation from [5]. We analyze a document containing $7lS$ sentences, with the sth sentence containing $n_{s}$ words, for $s$ &#x3D; $l, \ldots , n_{S}$ . One could use attention based on just the collection of words to classify the document. However a significant amount of important context is then left out of the analysis, since the model will consider all words as a single long sentence, and will therefore not consider the context within the separate sentences.Instead, one can use the hierarchical structure of a document (words form sentences, and sentences form the document) Fig. 8 illustrates the structure of hierarchical attention</p>
<p>For each sentence in the document,a sentence representa tion $\boldsymbol{c}^{(s)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{v}^{(S)}}$ is produced, for $s&#x3D;1,\ldots,n_{S}$, where $d_v^{(S)}$ is the dimension of the value vectors used in the attention model for sentence representations (Attention Modules in</p>

<p>Fig. 8). The representation is a context vector from an word, and $Tl_{8}$ represents the amount of words in sentence S For extra clarification, the columns of $F^{(s)}$ are feature vectors that correspond to the words in sentence 5 .As shown in Fig. 8, each feature matrix $F^{(s)}$ is used as input for an atten tion model,which produces the context vector $c^{(s)}$ , for each $s&#x3D;1,\ldots,n_{S}$ . No queries are used in this step, so it can be considered a self-attentive mechanism. The context vectors is constructed by grouping all the obtained context vectors together as columns. Finally, attention is calculated using $C$ as feature input, producing the representation of the entire tons oitetochis adoent in thonte vector $\boldsymbol{c}^{(D)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{v}^{(D)}}$ where $d_{v}^{(D)}$ is the dimension of the value vectors in the attention model for document representation (Attention Modulep in Fig. 8) This context vector can be used to classify the document, since it is essentially a summary of all the sentences (and therefore also the words)in the document Multi-level models can be used in a variety of tasks.</p>
<p>For example, in [28], hierarchical attention is used in a recommender system to model user preferences at the longterm level and the short-term level. Similarly, [45] proposes a hierarchical model for recommending social media images based on user preferences. Hierarchical attention has also been successfully applied in other domains.For example [46] proposes to use hierarchical attention in a video action recognition model to capture motion information at the the long-term level and the short-term level. Furthermore, [47] proposes a hierarchical attention model for cross-domain. sentiment classification. In [48], a hierarchical attention model for chatbot response generation is proposed.

<p>embeddings can allow one to create even higher quality representations. Similarly, [51] incorporates multiple representations of the same book (textual, syntactic, semantic visual etc.) into the feature model. Feature representations are an important part of the attention model, but attention can also be an important part of the feature model. The idea is to create a new representation by taking a weighted average of multiple representations, where the weights are determined via attention.This technique is referred to as multi-representational attention, and allows one to create so-called meta-embeddings. Suppose one wants to create a meta-embedding for a word 2 for which $E$ embeddings $\boldsymbol{x}^{(e_1)},\ldots,\boldsymbol{x}^{(e_E)}$ are available. Each embedding $x^{(e_{i})}$ is of size $d_{e_{i}t}$ for $i&#x3D;1,\ldots,E$ Since not all embeddings are of the same size,a transformation is performed to normalize the embedding dimensions. Using embedding-specific weight parameters, each embedding $x^{(e_i)}$ is transformed into the size-normalized embedding $x^{(t_{i})}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{t}}$ ,where $d_{t}$ is the size of every transformed word embedding, as shown in (21).<br>$$x^{(t_{i})}&#x3D;W_{e_{i}}\times x^{(e_{i})}+b_{e_{i}},\d_{t}\times1\quad d_{t}\times d_{e_{i}}\quad d_{e_{i}}\times1\quad d_{t}\times1$$</p>
<p>where $W_{e_{i}}$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{d_{t}\times d_{e_{i}}}$ and $b_{e_i}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_t}$ are trainable, embedding-specific weights matrices. The final embedding. $x^{(e)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_t}$ is a weighted average of the previously calculated transformed representations, as shown in (22)</p>
<p>$$\boldsymbol{x}<em>{d_t\times1}^{(e)}&#x3D;\sum</em>{i&#x3D;1}^Ea_i\times\boldsymbol{x}_{d_t\times1}^{(t_i)}.$$</p>
<p>The final representation $x^{(e)}$ can be interpreted as the context vector from an attention model,meaning that the weights $a_1,\ldots,a_E\in\mathbb{R}^1$ are attention weights. Attention can be calculated as normally, where the columns of the features matrix $F$ are the transformed representations $\boldsymbol{x}^{(t_1)},\ldots,\boldsymbol{x}^{(t_E)}$ Thequery in this case can be ignored since it is constant in all cases. Essentially, the query is “Which representations are the most important?”” in every situation. As such, this is a self-attentive mechanism While an interesting idea, applications of multi-</p>
<p>representational attention are limited. One example of the application of this technique is found in[52], where a multirepresentational attention mechanism has been applied to generate multi-lingual meta-embeddings. Another example is [53], where a multi-representational text classification embeddings from part-of-speech tagging, named entity rec ognizers, and character-level and word-level embeddings.</p>
<h3 id="3-2-General-Attention-Mechanisms"><a href="#3-2-General-Attention-Mechanisms" class="headerlink" title="3.2 General Attention Mechanisms"></a>3.2 General Attention Mechanisms</h3><p>can be applied in any type of attention model. The structure of this component can be broken down into the following sub-aspects: the attention score function, the attention alignment, and attention dimensionality</p>
<h2 id="3-2-1Attention-Scoring"><a href="#3-2-1Attention-Scoring" class="headerlink" title="3.2.1Attention Scoring"></a>3.2.1Attention Scoring</h2><p>The attention score function is a crucial component in how attention is calculated. Various approaches have been developed that each have their own advantages and disadvantages.An overview of these functions is provided in Table 2.</p>
<p>Each row of Table 2 presents a possible form for the function $\operatorname{score}(\boldsymbol{q},\boldsymbol{k}<em>l)$ , as seen in (23), where $q$ is the query vector, and $k</em>{l}$ is thelth column of $K$ Note that the score functions presented in this section can be more efficiently calculated in matrix form using $K$ instead of each column separately Nevertheless, the score functions are presented using $k_{I}$ to more clearly illustrate the relation between a key and query.</p>
<p>$$e_l&#x3D;\text{score}(\begin{array}{c}q\d_q\times1\end{array},\begin{array}{c}k_l\d_k\times1\end{array}).$$</p>
<p>Due to their simplicity, the most popular choices for the score function are the concatenate score function[3] and the multiplicative score function [4]. The multiplicative score function has the advantage of being computationally inexpensive due to highly optimized vector operations. How. ever, the multiplicative function may produce non-optimal results when the dimension $d_{k}$ is too large [56]. When $d_{k}$ is large, the dot-product between $q$ and $k_{I}$ can grow large in magnitude.To illustrate this, in [13], an example is used where the elements of $q$ and $k_l$ are all normally distributed with a mean equal to zero, and a variance equal to one. Then, the dot-product of the vectors has a variance of $d_{k}$ A higher variance means a higher chance of numbers that are large in magnitude. When the softmax function of the alignment step is then applied using these large numbers, the gradient will become very small, meaning the model will have trouble converging [13]. To adjust for this, [13] proposes to scale the multiplicative function by the factor mode is eaepesed t at nerpeate dferent eesene $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d_{k_{k}}}}$ prod ucing the caled utiplictiescore nc en </p>
<p>introducing a weights matrix $W$ .This form, referred to as the general score function, allows for an extra transformation of $k_l$ .The biased general score function [54]is a further extension of the general function that introduces This major category consists of attention mechanisms that a bias weight vector $b$ A final extension on this function named the activated general score function is introduced in [34], and includes the use of both a bias weight $b$, and an activation function act(). The previously presented score functions are all based on</p>
<p>determining a type of similarity between the key vector and the query vector. As such, more typical similarity measures such as the Euclidean $(\mathrm{L}_{2})$ distance and cosine similarity can also be implemented [55]. These scoring methods are summarized under the similarity score function which is represented by the similarity() function</p>
<p>There typically is no common usage across domains regarding score functions. The choice of score function for a particular task is most often based on empirical experiments. However, there are exceptions when, for example efficiency is vital. In models where this is the case, the multiplicative or scaled multiplicative score functions are typi-However, a compromise can be made in certain situations cally the best choice.An example of this is the TransformerLocal alignment [4] is a method that implements a softmax model, which is generally computationally expensive.</p>
<h3 id="3-2-2Attention-Alignment"><a href="#3-2-2Attention-Alignment" class="headerlink" title="3.2.2Attention Alignment"></a>3.2.2Attention Alignment</h3><p>The attention alignment is the step after the attention scoring. This alignment process directly determines which parts of the input data the model will attend to. The alignment function is denoted as align() and has various forms. The align() function takes as input the previously calculated attention score vector $e$ and calculates for each element $el$ of e the attention weight $u_{l}$ .These attention weights can then average of the value vectors $v_{1},\cdots,v_{n_{f}}$</p>
<p>$$\boldsymbol{c}<em>{d_v\times1}&#x3D;\sum</em>{l&#x3D;1}^{n_f}a_l:\times:\boldsymbol{v}_l:.$$</p>
<p>The most popular alignment method to calculate these weights is a simple softmax function, as depicted in (25)</p>
<p>$$\underset{1\times1}{a_l}&#x3D;\underset{1\times1}{\text{align}}(\underset{1\times1}{e_l}:;:\boldsymbol{e}:)&#x3D;\frac{\exp(e_l)}{\sum_{j&#x3D;1}^{n_f}\exp(e_j)}.$$</p>
<p>This alignment method is often referred to as soft alignment in computervision settings [8],or global alignment for sequence data [4]. Nevertheless, both these terms represent the same function and can be interpreted similarly. Soft&#x2F;global alignment can be interpreted as the model attending to all feature vectors.For example, the model attends to all regions in an image, or all words in a sentence. Even though the attention model generally does focus more on specific parts of the input, every part of the input will receive at least some amount of attention due to the nature of the softmax function. Furthermore, an advantage of the softmax function. is that it introduces a probabilistic interpretation to the input vectors. This allows one to easily analyze which parts of the input are important to the output predictions In contrast to soft&#x2F;global alignment, other methods aim</p>
<p>to achieve a more focused form of alignment. For example hard alignment [8], also known as hard attention or nondeterministic attention, is an alignment type that forces the attention model to focus on exactly one feature vector. Firstly, this method implements the softmax function in the exact same way as global alignment. However, the outputs $a_{1},\cdots,a_{n_{f}}$ are not used as weights for the context vector calculation. Instead, these values are used as probabilities to draw the choice of the one value vector from.A value $m\in\mathbb{R}^1$ is drawn from a multinomial distribution with $a_{1},\cdots,a_{n_{f}}$ as parameters for the probabilities. Then, the context vector is simply defined as follows:</p>
<p>$$\begin{array}{c}c\d_v\times1\end{array}&#x3D;\begin{array}{c}v_m\d_v\times1\end{array}.$$</p>
<p>Hard alignment is typically more efficient at inference compared to soft alignment.On the other hand, the main disadvantage of hard attention is that, due to the stochastic</p>
<p>alignment of attention, the training of the model cannot be done via the regular backpropagation method. Instead simulation and sampling, or reinforcement learning [57] are required to calculate the gradient at the hard attention layer. As such, soft&#x2F;global attention is generally preferred. distribution, similarly to soft&#x2F;global alignment. But, the. softmax distribution is calculated based only on a subset of the inputs. This method is generally used in combination with sequence data.One has to specify a variable $p\in\mathbb{R}^{1}$ that determines the position of the region.Feature vectors close to $p$ will be attended to by the model, and vectors too far from $P$ will be ignored. The size of the subset will be determined by the variable $D\in\mathbb{R}^{1}$ . Summarizing the attention model will apply a softmax function on the attention scores in the subset $[p-D,p+D]$ . In other words be used to create the context vector C by taking a weighteda window is placed on the input and soft&#x2F;global attention is calculated within that window：<br>$$a_{l}&#x3D;\text{align}(\begin{smallmatrix}e_{l}&amp;;&amp;e\1\times1&amp;n_{f}\times1\end{smallmatrix})&#x3D;\frac{\exp(e_{l})}{\sum_{j&#x3D;p-D}^{p+D}\exp(e_{j})}.$$</p>
<p>The question that remains is how to determine the location parameter $P$ The first method is referred to as monotonic alignment. This straightforward method entails simply setting the location parameter equal to the location of the prediction in the output sequence.Another method of deter mining the position of the region is referred to as predictive alignment. As the name entails, the model attempts to actually predict the location of interest in the sequence</p>
<p>$$p:&#x3D;:S:\times\mathrm{sigmoid}(\boldsymbol{w}<em>{1\times d</em>{p}}^{T}:\times\mathrm{tanh}(\boldsymbol{W}_{p}:\times:\boldsymbol{q}:)),$$</p>
<p>where $S\in\mathbb{R}^{1}$ is the length of the input sequence, and $w_{p}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{P}}$ and $W_{p}$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{d_{p}\times d_{q}}$ are both trainable weights parameters. The sigmoid function multiplied by $S$ makes sure that $p$ is in the range $[0,S]$ .Additionally, in [4], it is recommended to add an additional term to the alignment function to favor alignment around $P$</p>

<p>where $\sigma\in\mathbb{R}^{1}$ is empirically set equal to $\frac{D}{2}$ according to [4]. Another proposed method for compromising between soft and hard alignment is reinforced alignment[58]. Similarly to local alignment, a subset of the feature vectors is determined, for which soft alignment is calculated. However, instead of using a window to determine the subset, reinforced alignment uses a reinforcement learning agent. [57], similarly to hard alignment, to choose the subset of feature vectors. The attention calculation based on these chosen feature vectors is the same as regular soft alignment Soft alignment is often regarded as the standard align</p>
<p>ment function for attention models in practically every domain.Yet, the other alignment methods have also seen inter esting uses in various domains. For example, hard attention is used in [59] for the task of visual question answering In [60], both soft and hard attention are used in a graph attention model for multi-agent game abstraction. Similarly. in [61], both global and local alignment are used for review rating predictions. Reinforced alignment has been employed</p>
<p>in combination with a co-attention structure in [62] for the extended with the multi-dimensional attention mechanisn task of aspect sentiment classification. In [63], reinforced alignment is used for the task of person re-identification using surveillance images</p>
<h3 id="3-2-3-Attention-Dimensionality"><a href="#3-2-3-Attention-Dimensionality" class="headerlink" title="3.2.3 Attention Dimensionality"></a>3.2.3 Attention Dimensionality</h3><p>All previous model specifications of attention use a scalar weight $a_l$ for each value vector $v_l$ . This technique is referred to as single-dimensional attention. However, instead of determining a single attention score and weight for the entire vector, [64] proposes to calculate weights for every single feature in those vectors separately. This technique is referred to as multi-dimensional attention,since the attention weights now become higher dimensional vectors. The idea is that the model no longer has to attend to entire vectors, but it can instead pick and choose specific elements from those vectors. More specifically, attention is calculated for each dimension.As such,the model must create a vecto of attention weights $a_l\in\mathbb{H}^d_v$ for each value vector $v_l\in\mathbb{R}^dv$ The context vector can then be calculated by summing the element-wise multiplications (o) of the value vectors $\boldsymbol{v}<em>1,\ldots,\boldsymbol{v}</em>{n_f}\in\mathbb{R}^d$, and the corresponding attention weight vectors $a_{1},\ldots,a_{n_{f}}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\upsilon}}$ as follows:</p>
<p>$$\boldsymbol{c}<em>{d_v\times1}&#x3D;\sum</em>{l&#x3D;1}^{n_f}\boldsymbol{a}_l\circ\boldsymbol{v}_l.$$</p>
<p>However, since one needs to create attention weight vectors, this technique requires adjusted attention score and weight calculations. For example, the concatenate score function found in Table 2 can be adjusted by changing the $w\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\cos}}$ weights vector to the weight matrix $W_{d}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{w}\times d_{v}}$</p>
<p>$$e_{l}:&#x3D;:W_{d}^{T}:\times\mathrm{act}(:W_{1}:\times:q:+:W_{2}:\times:k_{l}:+:b:).$$</p>
<p>This new score function produces the attention score vectors $\boldsymbol{e}<em>1,\ldots,\boldsymbol{e}</em>{n_f}\in\mathbb{R}^dv$ . These score vectors can be combined into a matrix of scores $e$ &#x3D; $[ \boldsymbol{e}<em>{1}, \ldots , \boldsymbol{e}</em>{n_{f}}]$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{d_{v}\times n_{f}}$ To produce multi-dimensional attention weights, the alignment function stays the same, but it is applied for each feature across the attention score columns. To illustrate, when implementing soft attention, the attention weight produced from the ith element of score vector $e_{l}$ is defined as follows:</p>
<p>$$\underset{1\times1}{a_{l,i}}&#x3D;\underset{1\times1}{\text{align}}(e_{l,i};\quad\boldsymbol{e}<em>{d</em>{v}\times n_{f}})&#x3D;\frac{\exp(e_{l,i})}{\sum_{j&#x3D;1}^{n_{f}}\exp(e_{j,i})},$$</p>
<p>where $el,i$ represents the ith element of score vector $e_{l,}$ and $ul,i$ is the ith element of the attention weights vector $a_{l}$ .Finally, these attention weight vectors can be used to compute the context vector as presented in (30). Multi-dimensional attention is a very general mecha</p>
<p>nism that can be applied in practically every attention model, but actual applications of the technique have been relatively sparse. One application example is [65], where multi-dimensional attention is used in a model for named entity recognition based on text and visual context from multimedia posts. In [66], multi-dimensional attention is used in a model for answer selection in community question answering. In [67], the U-net model for medical image segmentation is extended with a multi-dimensional attention mechanism. Similarly, in [68], the Transformer model is</p>
<p>for the task of dialogue response generation. In [69], multidimensional attention is used to extend graph attention networks for dialogue state tracking. Lastly, for the task of next-item recommendation, [70] proposes a model that incorporates multi-dimensional attention</p>
<h3 id="3-3-Query-Related-Attention-Mechanisms"><a href="#3-3-Query-Related-Attention-Mechanisms" class="headerlink" title="3.3 Query-Related Attention Mechanisms"></a>3.3 Query-Related Attention Mechanisms</h3><p>Queries are an important part of any attention model, since they directly determine which information is extracted from the feature vectors. These queries are based on the desired output of the task model, and can be interpreted as literal questions. Some queries have specific characteristics that require specific types of mechanisms to process them. As such, this category encapsulates the attention mechanisms that deal with specific types of query characteristics. The mechanisms in this category dealwith one of the two following query characteristics: the type of queries or the multiplicity of queries</p>
<h2 id="3-3-1Type-of-Queries"><a href="#3-3-1Type-of-Queries" class="headerlink" title="3.3.1Type of Queries"></a>3.3.1Type of Queries</h2><p>Different attention models employ attention for different purposes, meaning that distinct query types are necessary There are basic queries, which are queries that are typically straightforward to definebased on the data and model.For example, the hidden state for one prediction in an RNN is often used as the query for the next prediction. One could also use a vector of auxiliary variables as query. For example, when doing medical image classification, general patient characteristics can be incorporated into a query Some attention mechanisms, such as co-attention, rota-</p>
<p>tory attention, and attention-over-attention, use specialized queries. For example, rotatory attention uses the context vector from another attention module as query, while interactive co-attention uses an averaged keys vector based on another input. Another case one can consider is when attention is calculated based purely on the feature vectors This concept has been mentioned before and is referred to as self-attention or intra-attention [71]. We say that the models use self-attentive queries. There are two ways of interpreting such queries. Firstly, one can say that the query is constant. For example, document classification requires only a single classification as the output of the model. As such, the query is always the same, namely: “What is the class of the document?”. The query can be ignored and attention can be calculated based only on the features themselves Score functions can be adjusted for this by making the query vector a vector of constants or removing it entirely:<br>$$\mathrm{score}(\boldsymbol{k}<em>{l})&#x3D;:\boldsymbol{w}^{T}\times\mathrm{act}(\boldsymbol{W}\times:\boldsymbol{k}</em>{l}+\boldsymbol{b}:).\d_{k}\times1\quad1\times d_{w}\quad d_{w}\times d_{k}\quad d_{k}\times1\quad d_{w}\times1$$</p>
<p>Additionally, one can also interpret self-attention as learning the query along the way, meaning that the query can be defined as a trainable vector of weights.For example,the dot-product score function may take the following form</p>
<p>$$\begin{array}{rcl}\mathrm{score}(\boldsymbol{k}_l)&amp;&#x3D;&amp;\boldsymbol{q}^T\times\boldsymbol{k}_l\d_k\times1&amp;&amp;1\times d_k&amp;d_k\times1\end{array},$$</p>
<p>where $q\in\mathbb{R}^{d_k}$ is a trainable vector of weights. One could also interpret vector $b\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{w}}$ as the query in (33).Another</p>
<p>use of self-attention istouncover the relations between the feature vectors $f_{1},\ldots,f_{n_{f}}$ . These relations can then be used as additional information to incorporate into new representations of the feature vectors. With basic attention mechanisms, the keys matrix $K$, and the values matrix $V$ are extracted from the features matrix $F_{\prime}$ while the query $q$ is produced separately. For this type of self-attention, the query vectors are extracted in a similar process as the keys and values, via a transformation matrix of trainable weights $W_{Q}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{q}\times d_{f}}$ . We define the matrix $Q&#x3D;\left[\boldsymbol{q}<em>{1},\ldots,\boldsymbol{q}</em>{n_{f}}\right]\in$ $\Pi$玻 $d_q\times nf$ which canbe obtained asfollows:</p>
<p>$$Q_{d_{q}\times n_{f}}&#x3D;W_{Q}\times F_{d_{f}\times n_{f}}.$$</p>
<p>Each column of $Q$ can be used as the query for the attention model. When attention is calculated using a query $q.$ the resulting context vector C will summarize the information the query, or a column of $Q$ , is now also a feature vector representation, the context vector contains the information of allfeature vectors that are important to that specific feature vector. In other words, the context vectors capture the relations between the feature vectors. For example, selfattention allows one to extract the relations between words: which verbs refer to which nouns, which pronouns refer to which nouns, etc. For images, self-attention can be used to determine which image regions relate to each other While self-attention is placed in the query-related cat-</p>
<p>egory, it is also very much related to the feature model. Namely, self-attention is a technique that is often used in the feature model to create improved representations of the feature vectors. For example, the Transformer model for language processing [13], and the Transformer model for image processing [15], both use multiple rounds of (multihead) self-attention to improve the representation of the feature vectors. The relations captured by the self-attention mechanism are incorporated into new representations. A. simple method of determining such a new representation is to simply set the feature vectors equal to the acquired self-attention context vectors [71], as presented in (36).</p>
<p>$$f_{_{d_f\times1}}^{(\mathrm{new})}&#x3D;\underset{d_f\times1}{\operatorname*{c}},$$</p>
<p>where $f^{(\mathrm{new})}$ is the updated feature vector. Another possibility is to add the context vectors to the previous feature vectors with an additional normalization layer [13]:</p>
<p>$$f_{d_f\times1}^{(\mathrm{new})}&#x3D;\mathrm{Normalize}(f_{d_f\times1}^{(\mathrm{old})}+\sum_{d_f\times1}),$$</p>
<p>where $f^{(\mathrm{old})}$ is the previous feature vector, and Normalize( is a normalization layer[72]. Using such techniques, self embeddings that enhance model accuracy [71]. Self-attention is arguably one of the more important</p>
<p>types of attention, partly due to its vital role in the highly popular Transformer model. Self-attention is a very general mechanism and can be applied to practically any problem. As such, self-attention has been extensively explored in many different fields in both Transformer-based architec tures and other types of models. For example, in [73], selfattention is explored for image recognition tasks, and results</p>
<p>indicate that the technique may have substantial advantages with regards to robustness and generalization. In [74], selfattention is used in a generative adversarial network (GAN) [75] to determine which regions of the input image to focus on when generating the regions of a new image. In [76], selfattention is used to design a state-of-the-art medical image segmentation model. Naturally, self-attention can also be used for video processing. In [77], a self-attention model is proposed for the purpose of video summarization that reaches state-of-the-art results. In other fields, like audio processing, self-attention has been explored as well. In [78], self-attention is used to create a speech recognition model Self-attention has also been explored in overlapping domains. For example, in [79], the self-attention Transformer architecture is used to create a model that can recognize phrases from audio and by lip-reading from a video. For the problem of next item recommendation, [80] proposes in the feature vectors that is important to the query. Sincea Transformer model that explicitly captures item-item re lations using self-attention. Self-attention also has applica-. tions in any natural language processing fields. For example, in [81], self-attention is used for sentiment analysis. Selfattention is also highly popular for graph models. For example, self-attention is explored in [82] for the purpose of representation learning in communication networks and rating networks. Additionally, the first attention model for graph networks was based on self-attention [83]</p>
<h3 id="3-3-2Multiplicity-ot-Queries"><a href="#3-3-2Multiplicity-ot-Queries" class="headerlink" title="3.3.2Multiplicity ot Queries"></a>3.3.2Multiplicity ot Queries</h3><p>In previous examples, the attention model generally used a single query for a prediction.We say that such models use singular query attention. However, there are attention architectures that allow the model to compute attention using multiple queries. Note that this is different from, for example, an RNN that may involve multiple queries to produce a sequence of predictions. Namely, such a model still requires only a single query per prediction One example of a technique that incorporates multiple</p>
<p>queries is multi-head attention [13], as presented in Fig. 9. Multi-head attention works by implementing multiple attention modules in parallel by utilizing multiple different versions of the same query. The idea is to linearly transform the query $q$ using different weight matrices. Each newly formed query essentially asks fora different type of relevant information, allowing the attention model to introduce more information into the context vector calculation. An attention model implements $d\geq1$ heads with each attention head having its own query vector, keys matrix, and values matrix $q^{(j)}$ ， $K^{(j)}$ and $V^{(j)}$ ，for $j$ &#x3D; $1, \ldots , d$ The query $q^{(j)}$ is obtained by linearly transforming the original query $\Psi$, while the matrices $K^{(j)}$ and $V^{(j)}$ are obtained through linear transformations of $F$ .As such,each attention head attention has been used to create improved word or sentence has its own learnable weights matrices $W_{q}^{(j)}$ ” $W_{K}^{(j)}$ and $W_{V}^{(j)}$ for these transformations.The calculation of the query keys, and values for the $j$ th head are defined as follows:<br>$$\boldsymbol{q}<em>{d</em>{q}\times1}^{(j)}&#x3D;\boldsymbol{W}<em>{q}^{(j)}\times\boldsymbol{q}</em>{d_{q}\times1},\quad\boldsymbol{K}<em>{d</em>{k}\times n_{f}}^{(j)}&#x3D;\boldsymbol{W}<em>{K}^{(j)}\times\boldsymbol{F}</em>{d_{f}\times n_{f}},\\boldsymbol{V}<em>{d</em>{v}\times n_{f}}^{(j)}&#x3D;\boldsymbol{W}<em>{V}^{(j)}\times\boldsymbol{F}</em>{d_{f}\times n_{f}}.$$</p>
<p>Thus,each head creates its own representations of the query $q$, and the input matrix $F$ Each head can therefore</p>
<p><img src="/./images/fLxYvsz8GoGucwnBRCXegWEcG76geRpkm.png"></p>
<p>Fig. 9. An illustration of multi-head attention</p>
<p>learn to focus on different parts of the inputs, allowing the model to attend to more information.For example when training a machine translation model, one attention head can learn to focus on which nouns (e.g., student, car, apple) do certain verbs (e.g., walking, driving, buying) refer to,while another attention head learns to focus on which $\boldsymbol{e}^{( j) }$ &#x3D; $[ e_{1}^{( j) }, \ldots , e_{n_{f}}^{( j) }]$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{n_{f}}$ ae $q^{(s)}$ Pr $q^{(0)}$ A $S$, Cat $q^{(s+1)}$ of ttention weights $\boldsymbol{a}^{( j) }$ &#x3D; $[ a_{1}^{( j) }, \ldots , a_{n_{f}}^{( j) }]$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{n_{f}}$ As canpossibly using the current context vector $c^{(s)}$ as another be expected, each attention model produces its own context vector $\boldsymbol{c}^{(j)}\in\mathbb{R}^{dv}$ ,as follows:</p>
<p>$$\boldsymbol{c}<em>{d</em>{v}\times1}^{(j)}&#x3D;\sum_{l&#x3D;1}^{n_{f}}a_{l}^{(j)}\times\boldsymbol{v}_{l}^{(j)}.$$</p>
<p>The goal is still to create a single context vector as output of the attention model.As such, the context vectors produced by the individual attention heads are concatenated into a single vector. Afterwards, a linear transformation is applied using the weight matrix $W_{O}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{c}\times d_{v}d}$ tomake sure the resulting context vector $c\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{c}}$ has the desired dimension. This calculation is presented in (40). The dimension $d_{c}$ can be pre-specified by, for example, setting it equal to $d_{v,}$ so that the context vector dimension is unchanged.</p>
<p>$$c:&#x3D;:W_{O}:\times\mathrm{concat}(\boldsymbol{c}^{(1)},…,\boldsymbol{c}^{(d)}).$$</p>
<p>Multi-head attention processes multiple attention modmented sequentially to iteratively adjust the context vec tors.Each of these attention modules are referred to as “repetitions” or “rounds” of attention. Such attention architectures are referred to as multi-hop attention models also known as multi-step attention models.An important note to consider is the fact that multi-hop attention tant mote to con sider is be ap thas m unt hap ustention she that the actunl o $c^{(s)}$ ind $q^{(s+1)}$ the atentoen noedelin throughout various works. While the mechanism always involves multiple rounds of attention, the multi-hop implementation proposed in [84] differs from the mechanism proposed in[85]or [86]. Another interesting example is [87], where a “multi-hop”attention model is proposed that would actually be considered alternating co-attention in this survey, as explained in Subsection 3.1.1. We present a general form of multi-hop attention that</p>
<p>is largely a generalization of the techniquesintroduced into produce the next context vector $c^{(s+1)}$ .Onemust note [85] and [88]. Fig. 10 provides an example implementation of a multi-hop attention mechanism. The general idea isweights,meaning that the number of parameters do not to iteratively transform the query, and use the query to transform the context vector,such that the model can extract different information in each step. Remember that a query</p>
<p><img src="/./images/fC2yeUZnAYXZanLazGfbKKQkNuntGh8I1.png"></p>
<p>Fig. 10.An example illustration of multi-hop attention. Solid arrows represent the base multi-hop model structure, while dotted arrows represent optional connections.</p>
<p>is similar to a literal question. As such, one can interpret the transformed queries as asking the same question in a different manner or from a different perspective, similarly to the queries in multi-head attention. The query that was previously denoted by $\Psi$ is now referred to as the initial input, and some transformation function transform()</p>
<p>$$\boldsymbol{q}<em>{d</em>{q}\times1}^{(s+1)}&#x3D;\mathrm{transform}(\boldsymbol{q}^{(s)},:\boldsymbol{c}^{(s)}).$$</p>
<p>For the specific form of the transformation function transform(),[85]proposes to use a mechanism similar to self-attention. Essentially, the queries used by the question answer matching model proposed in [85] were originally based on a set of feature vectors extracted from a question [85] also defines the original query $q^{(0)}$ as the unweighted average of these feature vectors.At each hop $S$, attention can be calculated on these feature vectors using the previous query $q^{(s)}$ as the query in this process.The resulting context vector of this calculation is the next query vector. Using the context vector $c^{(s)}$ instead of $q^{(s)}$ as the query for this process is also a possibility, which is similar to the LCRRot-hop model proposed in [43] and the multi-step model proposed in [88]. Such a connection is represented by the dotted arrows in Fig. 10. The transformation mechanism ules in parallel, but attention modules can also be imple-uses either the $q^{(s)}$ or the context vector $c^{(s)}$ as query, but a combination via concatenation is also possible. Each query representation is used as input for the at</p>
<p>tention module to compute attention on the columns of the feature matrix $F$ ,as seen previously. One main difference. however, is that the context vector $c^{(s)}$ is also used as input, score function is presented in (42). Note that the initial context vector $c^{(0)}$ is predefined.One way of doing thisis by setting it equal to the unweighted average of the value vectors $\boldsymbol{v}<em>1,\ldots,\boldsymbol{v}</em>{n_f}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_v}$ extracted from $F$</p>
<p>$$e_{l}^{(s)}&#x3D;\text{score}(\text{concat}(\boldsymbol{q}<em>{d</em>{q}\times1}^{(s+1)},\boldsymbol{c}^{(s)}),\boldsymbol{k}_{l}).$$</p>
<p>An alignment function and the value vectors are then used that in [85], the weights used in each iteration are the same scale with the number of repetitions. Yet,using multiple hops with different weight matrices can also be viable, as shown by the Transformer model [13] and in [88]. It may be</p>
<p>difficult to grasp why $c^{(s)}$ is part of the query input for the attention model. Essentially, this technique is closely related to self-attention in the sense that,in each iteration,a new context representation is created from the feature vectors and the context vector. The essence of this mechanism is that one wants to iteratively alter the query and the context vector,while attending to the feature vectors.In the process, the new representations of the context vector absorb more differentkinds of information.This is also the main difference between this type of attention and multi-head attention. Multi-head attention creates multiple context vectors from multiple queries and combines them to create a final context vector as output. Multi-hop attention iteratively. refines the context vector by incorporating information from the different queries. This does have the disadvantage of having to calculate attention sequentially Interestingly, due to the variations in which multi-hop</p>
<p>attention has been proposed, some consider the Transformer model’s encoder and decoder to consist of several singlehop attention mechanisms [84] instead of being a multihop model. However, in the context of this survey, we consider the Transformer model to be an alternative form of the multi-hop mechanism, as the features matrix $F$ is not directly reused in each step. Instead, $F$ is only used as an input for the first hop, and is transformed via self-attention into a new representation. The self-attention mechanism uses each feature vector in $F$ as a query, resulting in a matrix of context vectors as output of each attention hop. The $p_{1},\cdots,p_{d_{[0]}}$ as accurately as possible compared to the true intermediate context vectors are turned into matrices and represent iterative transformations of the matrix $F$ which are used in the consecutive steps. Thus, the Transformer model iteratively refines the features matrix $F$ by extracting and incorporating new information When dealing with a classification task, another idea is</p>
<p>to use a different query for each class. This is the basic principle behind capsule-based attention [89], as inspired by the capsule networks [90]. Suppose we have the feature classes that the model can predict. Then, a capsule-based attention model defines a capsule for each of the $d_{y}$ classes that each take as input the feature vectors.Each capsule consists of, in order, an attention module, a probability module, and a reconstruction module, which are depicted in. Fig. 11. The attention modules all use self-attentive queries so each module learns its own query: “Which feature vectors are important to identify this class?”. In [89], a self-attentive multiplicative score function is used for this purpose</p>
<p>$$e_{c,l}&#x3D;\begin{array}{ccc}\boldsymbol{q}_c^T&amp;\times&amp;\boldsymbol{k}_l\1\times1&amp;1\times d_k&amp;d_k\times1\end{array},$$</p>
<p>where $e_{c,l}\in\mathbb{R}^1$ is the attention score for vector $l$ in capsule $U_{f}$ and $q_{c}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_k}$ is a trainable query for capsule $C_{f}$ for $c&#x3D;1,\ldots,d_{y}$ . Each attention module then uses an alignment function, and uses the produced attention weights to determine a context vector $c_{c}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{v}}$ .Next, the context vector $C_{t}$ is fed through a probability layer consisting of a linear transformation with a sigmoid activation function:</p>
<p>$$\begin{aligned}p_{c}&amp;&#x3D;\mathrm{sigmoid}(\boldsymbol{w}<em>{c}^{T}\times\boldsymbol{c}</em>{c}:+:b_{c}:),\&amp;<em>{1\times1}\times d</em>{v}\quad d_{v}\times1\quad1\times1\end{aligned}$$</p>
<p><img src="/./images/fFOVLaKiKKX8YVu44wZt6GwmcOzskqWOp.png"></p>
<p>Fig. 11. An illustration of capsule-based attention</p>
<p>where $w_c\in\mathbb{R}^dv$ and $b_{c}\in\mathbb{R}^{1}$ are trainable capsule-specific weights parameters, and $p_{c}\in\mathbb{R}^{1}$ is the predicted probability that the correct class is class $t$ . The final layer is the reconstruction module that creates a class vector representation This representation $r_{c}\in\mathbb{R}^{dv}$ is determined by simply multiplying the context vector $C_{c}$ by the probability $P_{c}$</p>
<p>$$\begin{array}{rcl}r_c&amp;&#x3D;&amp;p_c\times&amp;c_c\d_v\times1&amp;&amp;1\times1&amp;&amp;d_v\times1\end{array}.$$</p>
<p>The capsule representation is used when training the model. First of all, the model is trained to predict the probabilities values. Secondly, via a joint loss function, the model is also trained to accurately construct the capsule representations ${\boldsymbol{r}}1,\cdots,{\boldsymbol{r}}d_{\psi}$ . A features representation $f\in\mathbb{R}^{d_f}$ is defined which is simply the unweighted average of the original feature vectors. The idea is to train the model such that vector representations from capsules that are not the correct class differ significantly from $f$ while the representation from the correct capsule is very similar to $f$ A dot-product between the capsule representations and the features representation vectors $f_{1}, \ldots , f_{n_{f}}$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R} ^{d_{f}}$ , and suppose there are are $d_{y}$ is used in [89] as a measure of the distance between the vectors. Note that $d_v$ must equal $d_{f}$ in this case, otherwise the vectors would have incompatible dimensions. Interestingly, since attention is calculated for each class individually, one can track which specific feature vectors are important for which specific class. In [89], this idea is used to discover which words correspond to which sentiment class. The number of tasks that can make use of multiple</p>
<p>queries is substantial, due to how general the mechanisms are.As such, the techniques described in this section have been extensively explored in various domains.For example, multi-head attention has been used for speaker recog nition based on audio spectrograms [91]. In [92], multihead attention is used for recommendation of news articles. Additionally, multi-head attention can be beneficial for graph attention models as well [83]. As for multi-hop attention, quite a few papers have been mentioned before but there are still many other interesting examples.For example, in [93], a multi-hop attention model is proposed for medication recommendation. Furthermore, practically every Transformer model makes use of both multi-head and multi-hop attention. The Transformer model has been extensively explored in various domains. For example, in [94], a Transformer model is implemented for image cap-</p>
<p>tioning. In [95], Transformers are explored for medical image segmentation. In [96], a Transformer model is used for emotion recognition in text messages. A last example of an application of Transformers is [17], which proposes a Transformer model for recommender systems. In comparison with multi-head and multi-hop attention, capsule-based attention is arguably the least popular of the mechanisms discussed for the multiplicity of queries. One example is [97], where an attention-based capsule network is proposed that also includes a multi-hop attention mechanism for the purpose of visual question answering. Another example is [98], where capsule-based attention is used for aspect-level sentiment analysis of restaurant reviews. The multiplicity of queries is a particularly interesting ang Parlprioyesong ar th nthe fieldof audipor 108</p>
<p>category due to the Transformer model [13], which com provements and iterations of the model have been produced that typically aim to improve the predictive performance, the computational efficiency, or both.For example, the Transformer-XL [99] is an extension of the original Trans former that uses a recurrence mechanism to not be limited by a context window when processing the outputs.This allows the model to learn significantly longer dependencies while also being computationally more efficient during the evaluation phase. Another extension of the Transformer is known as the Reformer model [100]. This model is signifi cantly more efficient computationally, by means of localitysensitive hashing, and memory-wise, by means of reversible residual layers. Such computational improvements are vital, since one of the main disadvantages of the Transformer model is the sheer computational cost due to the complexity of the model scaling quadratically with the amount of input feature vectors. The Linformer model [101] manages to reduce the complexity of the model to scale linearly, while achieving similar performance as the Transformer model This is achieved by approximating the attention weights using a low-rank matrix. The Lite-Transformer model proposed in [102] achieves similar results by implementing two branches within the Transformer block that specialize in capturing global and local information. Another interesting Transformer architecture is the Synthesizer [103] This model replaces the pairwise self-attention mechanism with “synthetic attention weights. Interestingly, the per formance of this model is relatively close to the original Transformer, meaning that the necessity of the pairwise self-attention mechanism of the Transformer model may be questionable.For a more comprehensive overview of Transformer architectures, we refer to [104].</p>

Using these performance measures, an attention model can either be compared to other state-of-the-art models, or an ablation study can be performed. If possible, the importance of the attention mechanism can be tested by replacing it with another mechanism and observing whether the overall performance of the model decreases [105], [115] An example of this is replacing the weighted average used to produce the context vector with a simple unweighted average and observing whether there is a decrease in overall model performance [35]. This ablation method can be used to evaluate whether the attention weights can actually distinguish important from irrelevant informationd</p>
<h3 id="4-2Intrinsic-Evaluation"><a href="#4-2Intrinsic-Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="4.2Intrinsic Evaluation"></a>4.2Intrinsic Evaluation</h3><p>Attention models can also be evaluated using attentionspecific intrinsic performance measures.In [4], the attention weights are formally evaluatedvia the Alignment Error Rate (AER) to measure the accuracy of the attention weights with respect to annotated attention vectors. [116] incorporates this idea into an attention model by supervising the attention mechanism using gold attention vectors A joint loss function consisting of the regular task-specific loss and the attention weights loss function is constructed for this purpose. The gold attention vectors are based on annotated text data sets where keywords are hand-labelled. However, since attention is inspired by human attention, one could evaluate attention models by comparing them to the attention behaviour of humans.</p>
<h3 id="4-2-1-Evaluation-via-Human-Attention"><a href="#4-2-1-Evaluation-via-Human-Attention" class="headerlink" title="4.2.1 Evaluation via Human Attention"></a>4.2.1 Evaluation via Human Attention</h3><p>In [117], the concept of attention correctness is proposed which is a quantitative intrinsic performance metric that evaluates the quality of the attention mechanism based on actual human attention behaviour. Firstly, the calculation of this metric requires data that includes the attention behaviour of a human.For example, a data set containing images with the corresponding regions that a human focuses on when performing a certain task, such as image captioning.The collection of regions focused on by the human is referred to as the ground truth region. Suppose an attention model attends to the $n_{f}$ feature vectors $f_1,\ldots,\boldsymbol{f}<em>{n_f}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_f}$ Feature vector $f_i$ corresponds to region $R</em>{i}$ of the given</p>

<p>Thus, this metric is equal to the sum of the attention weights for the ground truth regions.Since the attention weights sum up to 1 due to, for example, a softmax alignment function, the $AC$ value will be a value between O and 1.

Therefore, observing which parts of the inputs the model focuses on can be helpful in determining if the tation of the behaviour of models that are typically known to be black boxes.However, rather than checking if the model focuses onthemost important parts of thedatasome use the attention weights to determine which parts of the data are most important. This would imply that attention models provide a type of explanation, which is a subject of contention among researchers. Particularly, in [120], extensive experiments are conducted for various natural language processing tasks to investigate the relation between attention weights and important information to determine whether attention can actually provide meaningful explanations. In this paper titled “Attention is not Explanation” it is found that attention weights do not tend to correlate with important features. Additionally, the authors are able to replace the produced attention weights with completely different values while keeping the model output the same. These so-called “adversarial attention distributions show that an attention model may focus on completely different information and still come to the same conclusions, which makes interpretation difficult. Yet, in another paper titled “Attention is not not Explanation”[121], the claim that attention is not explanation is questioned by challenging the assumptions of the previous work.It is found that the adversarial attention distributions do not perform as reliably well as the learned attention weights, indicating that it was not proved that attention is not viable for explanation. In general, the conclusion regarding the interpretability</p>

Attention models often focus on much larger regions or multiple small non-adjacent regions.As such,a technique to improve attention models is to allow the model to learn from human attention patterns via a joint loss of the regular loss function and an attention weight loss function based on the human gaze behaviour, similarly to how annotated attention vectors are used in [116] to supervise the attention mechanism. [117] proposes to use human attention data to supervise the attention mechanism in such a manner. Similarly, a state-of-the-art video captioning model is proposed in [119] that learns fromof attention models is that researchers must be extremely human gaze data to improve the attention mechanism</p>

<h2 id="5CONCLUSION"><a href="#5CONCLUSION" class="headerlink" title="5CONCLUSION"></a>5CONCLUSION</h2><p>In this survey, we have provided an overview of recent research on attention models in deep learning. Attention mechanisms have been a prominent development for deep learning models as they have shown to improve model performance significantly, producing state-of-the-art results for various tasks in several fields of research. We have presented a comprehensive taxonomy that can be used to categorize and explain the diverse number of attention mechanisms proposed in the literature. The organization of the taxonomy wasmotivated based on the structure ofa taskmodel that consists of a feature model, an attention model, a query model, and an output model. Furthermore, the attention mechanisms have been discussed using a framework based on queries, keys, and values. Last, we have shown how one can use extrinsic and intrinsic measures to evaluate the performance of attention models, and how one can use the taxonomy to analyze the structure of attention models The attention mechanism is typically relatively simple</p>
<p>to understand and implement and can led to signficant25. 2015, 412-1 He, Amola, and E Hovy improvements in performance.As such, it is no surprise that this is a highly active field of research with new attention mechanisms and models being developed constantly. Not only are new mechanisms consistently being developed but there is also still ample opportunity for the exploration of existing mechanisms for new tasks. For example, multidimensional attention[64] is a technique that shows promis dienqaM almost any attention model. However, it has not seen much application in current works. Similarly, multi-head atten-. tion [13] is a technique that can be efficiently parallelized and implemented in practically any attention model.Yet it is mostly seen only in Transformer-based architectures. Lastly, similarly to how [43] combines rotatory attention with multi-hop attention, combining multi-dimensional at-. tention, multi-head attention, capsule-based attention, or any of the other mechanisms presented in this survey may produce new state-of-the-art results for the various fields of research mentioned in this survey. This survey has mainly focused on attention mech</p>
<p>anisms for supervised models,since these comprise the largest proportion of the attention models in the literature. In comparison to the total amount of research that has been done on attention models,research on attention models for semi-supervised learning [123], [124] or unsupervised learning [125], [126] has received limited attention and has only become active recently. Attention may play a more significant role for such tasks in the future as obtaining research on attention models can advance even further. For example, we mentioned the fact that attention weights can be trained directly based on hand-annotated data[116] or actual human attention behaviour[117], [119]. As new data sets are released,future research may focus on developing attention models that can incorporate those types of data.</p>
<p>While attention is intuitively easy to understand,there still is a substantial lack of theoretical support for attention As such, we expect more theoretical studies to additionally contribute to the understanding of the attention mechanisms in complex deep learning systems. Nevertheless, the practical advantages of attention models are clear. Since attention models provide significant performance improve-. ments in a variety of fields, and as there are ample opportunities for more advancements, we foresee that these models will still receive significant attention in the time to come.</p>
